# GreyHackScripts
Dabbling at coding custom scripts for the [Grey Hack](https://greyhackgame.com/) computer game.

It's easier to code these files in VS Code than in the game, and I like to save my work, so this lives in git as a result.

*Disclaimer: All of these files are for use in a computer game. These files are not intended for any actual usage on real computer system, though I doubt such a thing is even possible.*

If you're interested in learning actual hacking in a safe, legal, and controlled environment, I recommend [Hack the Box Academy](https://www.hackthebox.com/) as a good learning ground.

## Scripting

See [https://documentation.greyscript.org/](https://documentation.greyscript.org/) for documentation on the GreyScript scripting language.

## Scripts

The following scripts exist:

- *wifi-access* - built to automatically gain access to the strongest WiFi node. Currently in development.
